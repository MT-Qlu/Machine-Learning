# Trend Analysis

This workspace contains unsupervised techniques for extracting and interpreting long-term trends from temporal data. Use it to explore smoothing filters, moving averages, and decomposition methods before downstream modelling.

## Getting Started

- Review `src/` for reusable helpers that compute rolling statistics and structural trend components.
- Use the notebooks for exploratory experiments that visualise detrended series and compare smoothing windows.
- Store sample datasets or synthetic generators in `data/` with notes about their origin.
- Persist diagnostic outputs, plots, or serialised transformations in `artifacts/` to keep the pipeline reproducible.

Document new approaches (seasonal trend decomposition, STL variants, etc.) inside this README as they are added.
