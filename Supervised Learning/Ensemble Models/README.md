# Ensemble Learning Suite

**Location:** `Machine-Learning/Supervised Learning/Ensemble Models`

Ensemble methods combine multiple base learners to deliver stronger generalisation than any individual model. This suite mirrors the repository’s standard project structure (data, src, notebooks, artifacts, demo) so you can train, evaluate, and serve bagging and boosting pipelines alongside other supervised modules.

## Structure

- `Bagging/` — Bootstrap aggregating and random forest implementations.
- `Boosting/` — Gradient boosting, stochastic GBM, AdaBoost, and XGBoost variants.

Each submodule includes its own README with dataset details, CLI commands, and FastAPI integration tips.
