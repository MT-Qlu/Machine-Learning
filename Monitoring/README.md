# Monitoring & Observability

Use this space to design playbooks for tracking model health in production. Planned components include:

- Data drift, concept drift, and performance decay monitors building on metrics from `Essentials Toolkit/Errors/metrics.py`.
- Alerting pipelines that plug into logging/observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, etc.).
- Example dashboards summarising predictions, errors, and service-level indicators.
- Runbooks for investigation and rollback when monitored metrics breach thresholds.

Detailed guides, sample configurations, and reusable scripts will land here as monitoring automation evolves.
