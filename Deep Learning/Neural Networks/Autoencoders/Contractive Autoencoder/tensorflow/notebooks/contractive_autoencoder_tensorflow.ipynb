    "# TensorFlow Contractive Autoencoder Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this notebook\n",
    "- Explore the TensorFlow implementation of the contractive autoencoder built in `../src`.\n",
    "- Provide guidance on training with analytic contractive penalties inside a custom `train_step`.\n",
    "- Mirror the PyTorch experience to support cross-framework comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "- Configure contractive penalty strength and monitor its interaction with reconstruction loss.\n",
    "- Train the model and inspect logged metrics (loss, PSNR, contractive penalty).\n",
    "- Reconstruct samples and reason about robustness improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- TensorFlow 2.x installed; GPU acceleration optional.\n",
    "- Understanding of the vanilla and denoising notebooks is helpful.\n",
    "- Optional: calculus familiarity to appreciate the Jacobian penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook workflow\n",
    "1. Import configuration, training, and inference helpers from `tensorflow/src`.\n",
    "2. Execute `train(CONFIG)` to fit the contractive autoencoder and capture metrics.\n",
    "3. Load the trained model and reconstruct batches using `reconstruct`.\n",
    "4. Extend the notebook with penalty visualisations, sensitivity analysis, or alternative architectures.\n"
