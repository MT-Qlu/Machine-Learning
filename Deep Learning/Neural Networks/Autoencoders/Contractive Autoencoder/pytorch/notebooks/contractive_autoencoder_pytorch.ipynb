    "# PyTorch Contractive Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this notebook\n",
    "- Walk through a minimal contractive autoencoder training loop on Fashion-MNIST.\n",
    "- Highlight how the Jacobian penalty is computed and logged so you can monitor robustness.\n",
    "- Provide copy-paste friendly snippets for training, evaluation, and reconstruction experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "- Understand how to configure the contractive weight and inspect its effect on reconstruction metrics.\n",
    "- Learn how to hook into the modular `src` package for reusable training utilities.\n",
    "- Practise visualising reconstructions and latent behaviour once the model is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- PyTorch 2.x with torchvision installed (see project README for versions).\n",
    "- Familiarity with the vanilla autoencoder notebook in this directory tree.\n",
    "- Optional: TensorBoard if you want to live-track penalty metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset + artefacts\n",
    "- Dataset: Fashion-MNIST (downloaded automatically by the data loader).\n",
    "- Checkpoints: saved to `artifacts/pytorch_contractive_ae/contractive_autoencoder.pt`.\n",
    "- Metrics: `metrics.json` captures reconstruction loss, PSNR, and penalty values per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook workflow\n",
    "1. Import the shared config and helpers.\n",
    "2. Launch `train()` to fit the model and persist artefacts.\n",
    "3. Reconstruct a mini-batch and explore outputs with the provided utilities.\n",
    "4. Extend the notebook with your own visualisations (e.g., penalty curves, latent traversals).\n"

    "- Plotting the returned dictionary with pandas/Matplotlib is a quick way to visualise convergence.\n",
