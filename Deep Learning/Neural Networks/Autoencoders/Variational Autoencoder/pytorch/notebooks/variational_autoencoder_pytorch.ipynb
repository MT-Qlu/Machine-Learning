    "\n",
    "### Why this notebook\n",
    "- Guide you through training and sampling from the VAE implementation in `../src`.\n",
    "- Highlight how the KL divergence term interacts with reconstruction loss.\n",
    "- Provide ready-to-run code for reconstruction, sampling, and latent exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "- Train the VAE on Fashion-MNIST while logging KL and reconstruction metrics.\n",
    "- Reconstruct held-out samples and generate new images from the learned latent prior.\n",
    "- Adjust KL weight and latent dimension to study their impact on sample quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- PyTorch 2.x, torchvision, and Matplotlib installed.\n",
    "- Understanding of basic autoencoder concepts and Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "- Optional: familiarity with the reparameterisation trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook workflow\n",
    "1. Import config, training, and inference helpers from the PyTorch `src` package.\n",
    "2. Execute `train(CONFIG)` and inspect the returned metrics.\n",
    "3. Load the trained model, reconstruct samples, and draw fresh latent samples via `sample`.\n",
    "4. Extend with latent traversal plots, KL annealing experiments, or evaluation metrics (FID, inception scores).\n"
