# Benchmark Tools

This area will collect reproducible benchmarking harnesses that compare model families across shared datasets. Planned additions include:

- Scenario-driven benchmark suites for tabular, time-series, and text workloads.
- Automation scripts for batch evaluation using the utilities in `errors/metrics.py`.
- Summary dashboards highlighting accuracy, latency, and resource consumption trade-offs.

Repository-wide integration steps, configuration templates, and execution guides will be added as the benchmarking utilities take shape.
