# Evaluation Playbooks

This section will document end-to-end evaluation workflows that sit on top of the shared metric utilities in `errors/metrics.py`. Upcoming content will include:

- How to wire metrics into training pipelines, notebook experiments, and API endpoints.
- Standard evaluation splits, cross-validation recipes, and statistical significance checks.
- Templates for regression, classification, clustering, and time-series scorecards.
- Guidance on integrating experiment tracking tools to capture metadata and artefacts.

As the evaluation toolkit matures, this README will expand with concrete examples and automation tips.
